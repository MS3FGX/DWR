Dope Wars
==

Around 2001 I started work on my first large scale programming project: a fully graphical version of the ever popular ["Dope Wars"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugwars). At the time, everyone was playing this on their Ti calculators, and it seemed like a relatively easy project to take on as it didn't require AI, physics, or any of the other tricky bits of game development.

I recently found a backup copy of the source code and art files for the game in my attic; and thought that as the 20th anniversary of the release of this particular piece of software isn't far off, it would be interesting to see if I could get the game running and perhaps even improve upon the original a bit.

QB45 Branch
==

The code in this branch is very nearly identical to the original version; with only some minor adjustments (removed DRM, updated credits, etc). This is to serve as a reference point for how the game looked/ran when originally released.

Binaries are provided for Linux and Windows, and the game appears to be fully playable on both.

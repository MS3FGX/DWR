Dope Wars: Resurrection
==

Around 2001 I started work on my first large scale programming project: a fully graphical version of the ever popular ["Dope Wars"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugwars). At the time, everyone was playing this on their Ti calculators, and it seemed like a relatively easy project to take on as it didn't require AI, physics, or any of the other tricky bits of game development.

I recently found a backup copy of the source code and art files for the game in my attic; and thought that as the 20th anniversary of the release of this particular piece of software isn't far off, it would be interesting to see if I could get the game running and perhaps even improve upon the original a bit.

Development
==

I was still using MS-DOS as my primary operating system in 2001, and as such the game was developed in QBasic 4.5, which was the only development environment the OS shipped with.

While QB45 can still be run under [DOSBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOSBox) (and indeed, that's how I'm currently working on the source), my plan is to switch over to [QB64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QB64) and potentially make use of the new capabilities that would bring.
